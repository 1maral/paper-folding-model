Overview:

### A Computational Model for Reasoning About the Paper Folding Task Using Visual Mental Images

Our project develops a computational cognitive (AI) model to simulate solving visuospatial tasks, focusing on ``paper folding``. The general goal is to understand how cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, help with tasks that require visualizing and manipulating objects in space. The Artificial Intelligent model we present simulates mental rotations in three dimensions to solve the "Punched Hole" paper folding task, where the task is to determine what the paper would look like when unfolded. This model maintains a three-dimensional representation of the paper, storing each fold as a two-dimensional image in a stack. The results aim to offer better understanding of cognitive challenges in spatial tasks and could lead to new ways to train people and children to improve their spatial abilities in education.
